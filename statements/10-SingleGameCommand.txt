    If you arrived here with everything completed and working, it means
    you have developed all the game's functionality!

    However, in this statement we will add an 'abstraction' layer that
    will allow us to create game 'commands'. From now on, we are going
    to work with the following commands:

        路 'l': will be the game command to turn left
        路 'r': will be the game command to turn right
        路 'f': will be the game command to move forward
        路 'b': will be the game command to move backward

    To handle these commands, create a new function with the name
    'executeGameCommand' that will receive the 'game' object as first
    parameter, and a string as second parameter that will contain the
    command ('l', 'r', 'f', 'b').

    Your function will have to check the command that has been received
    and call the correct robot movement functions you created before.

    For example, for the 'l' command we will have to call the function
    we created to turn our robot left.

    If our function receives an unknown command, the following message
    should be shown in the console:

        "Unknown command: '<command>'"

    For example, if we call our new 'executeGameCommand' function with
    the command 'p', we should see the following message in the console:

        "Unknown command: 'p'"

    To see if you did it correctly, use the HTML interface to move the
    robot. If something does not work, check the browser's console error
    messages. If none appears, just check again your code and look for
    possible wrong lines.

    WARNING: it is very important to name the function as the statement
             suggests ('executeGameCommand'). If you put another name,
             the HTML interface will not know you implemented this
             functionality!
