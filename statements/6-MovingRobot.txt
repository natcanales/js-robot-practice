    We are now going to create the functions that will allow our robot
    to move all along the grid.

    Create a function called 'moveForward' that will receive the robot
    object as parameter. The function will have to modify the robot's
    'x' and 'y' properties, depending on the current direction.

    Here we add a little reference to guide you:

        x0/y0  y1  y2  y3  y4

        x1        N
                  |
        x2        |
            W-----·-----E
        x3        |
                  |
        x4        S

        x5

    As you can see, if our robot is looking to "N" (North) and it moves
    forward, its 'x' value will decrease. As an another example, if the
    robot is looking to "E" (East) and moves forward, its 'y' value will
    increase.

    Once you have the 'moveForward' function completed, test it by
    pressing the '⬆' button within the 'Robot controls' panel in the HTML
    website we provided you. If you do not initially turn the robot in
    a direction within the grid, you may see the robot disappear. Do not
    worry for that yet: if you rotate it and see the icon that represents
    the robot move in the correct direction, you did it well!

    Once you checked that your 'moveForward' function works well, create a
    'moveBackward' function in order to allow the robot move backwards,
    too.

    To check if the developed function works well, do the same as before
    but this time pressing the '⬇' button. If you see the 'robot' moving
    in the opposite direction he is looking at (e.g., it looks "N" and
    moves to "S"), it means you completed this statement successfully!

    If something does not work, open the browser's console and check the
    error messages to find out the errors.

    WARNING: it is important to name your functions as the statement
             says ('moveForward' and 'moveBackward') or the HTML will not
             detect that you created the functions to move the robot.
