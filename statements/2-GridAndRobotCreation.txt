/*****************************************************************************

    Call the 'createGrid' function you previously created and store
    its returned value in a variable with the name you want. You decide
    the number of rows and columns you want to create the grid with.

    Create now an object that will represent our robot in the game.
    The object will have the following properties/keys:

        · x: will tell us the number of the row in which our robot is
             located; its initial value is 0

        · y: will tell us the number of the column in which our robot
             is located; its initial value is 0

        · direction: will tell us the direction in which our robot
                     is looking at. The possible values for this
                     key will be the four cardinal points:

                        "N", "S", "E", "W"

                     The initial value will be "N"


    NOTE: it is important to keep the properties/keys names as specified
          in the statement. You must call the properties 'x', 'y' and
          'direction'. Other names will not be correct.
