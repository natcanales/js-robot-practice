    Create now an object called 'game' that will have the following
    properties/keys:

        · grid: will have as value the previously created matrix

        · robot: will have as value the previously created object

    It is important to keep the names as specified in the statement:
    the created object must be called 'game', and its properties/keys
    have to be 'grid' and 'robot'. Other names will not be correct.

    Once you created the 'game' object, open the project's 'index.html'
    file in Google Chrome. You should see a grid at the left side with
    the size you decided earlier.

    In the x and y position you specified for the robot, you should
    see an icon pointing to the direction in which your robot is
    looking. That icon will represent our robot, as it will tell us
    both its position and its direction. With the default values of
    x=0, y=0 and direction="N", we should see an icon with an arrow
    pointing up ('north') at the most top-left cell of our grid.

    You can press the 'Robot controls' panel buttons, but a message
    will appear saying no functions were still implemented for that
    by your side. The following steps will be to effectively create
    some functions so the robot can really move by pressing those
    buttons.
