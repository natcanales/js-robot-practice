    We are now going to process several commands at once. This is the
    last step!

    Create a function called 'executeMultipleCommands' that will receive
    the 'game' object as first parameter, and a string as second parameter
    that will contain several chained commands.

    Your function will first have to check if the second parameter is
    of type 'string' in order to make everything work correctly. If the
    second parameter is not a string, the function will only show the
    following message in the console:

        "Invalid commands!"

    If the second parameter is a string, we will go character by
    character calling the 'executeGameCommand' function we previously
    created.

    For example, we could call the 'executeMultipleCommands' function
    like this:

        executeMultipleCommands(game, "rffflbbbb")

    which would internally call our 'executeGameCommand' with every
    'letter' of our string, executing all the commands:

        路 Turn right once
        路 Move forward three times
        路 Turn left once
        路 Move backward four times

    To see if you did it correctly, open the HTML interface. You should
    now see a new button inside the 'Robot controls' panel, with a
    'recording icon'. If you press it, a new panel appears with a
    'Recording commands' area. Press the robot movement buttons as you
    were doing until now: one by one the commands will be 'recorded',
    and the robot will not move until you press the 'Run all!' button.

    To help you know where the robot is while recording commands, we
    are showing every cell the robot will visit with a green color.
    If you want to cancel the 'recording session' you only have to
    press again the 'recording icon' button within the 'Robot controls'
    panel.

    WARNING: it is very important to name the function as the statement
             suggests ('executeMultipleCommands'). If you put another
             name, the HTML interface will not know you implemented this
             functionality and will not show the 'record' button.
