    We have given you a Website project inside the 'code' folder.
    Your goal will be to make it work correctly only by developing
    JavaScript code as we will ask you for in the following statements.

    The goal of the project/game is to be able to move a 'robot' inside
    a grid. The code you will develop will create the grid and allow
    the robot to move within it.

    To begin with this exercise, you must first create a file called
    'robotGame.js' inside the 'code' folder of the project.

    You do not have to worry about the other project's files. The
    'robotGame.js' file will be the only one you will have to edit
    during the exercise.

    Every code development requested in the following statments will
    have to be included in the new file you have created.

    WARNING: it is important for you to use the exact names we will
             give you in the statements. For example, as we told you
             to create a new file with the name of 'robotGame.js',
             other names will not be correct.

             As so, you cannot name the file 'RobotGame.js',
             'robotgame.js', and so on.
