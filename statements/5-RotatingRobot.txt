    We are now going to create the functions that will allow our robot
    to rotate left and right.

    Create a function called 'turnLeft' that will receive the robot
    object as parameter. The function will have to modify the robot's
    direction property, depending on the current one.

    Here we add a little reference in order to avoid mistakes:

              N
              |
              |
        W-----·-----E
              |
              |
              S

    As you can see, if our robot is looking to "N" (North) and it turns
    left, the new direction will be "W" (West).

    Once you have the 'turnLeft' function completed, test it by pressing
    the '↺' button within the 'Robot controls' panel in the HTML website
    we provided you. If you see the icon that represents the robot rotate
    in the good direction, you did it well!

    Once you checked that your 'turnLeft' function works well, create a
    'turnRight' function in order to allow the robot turn in that
    direction, too.

    To check if the developed function works well, do the same as before
    but this time pressing the '↻' button. If you see the 'robot' turning
    in the desired direction, it means you completed this statement
    successfully!

    If something does not work, open the browser's console and check the
    error messages to find out the errors.

    WARNING: it is important to name your functions as the statement
             says ('turnLeft' and 'turnRight') or the HTML will not
             detect that you created the functions to rotate the robot.
